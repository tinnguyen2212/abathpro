<p><b>Refinishing</b><b> a bathtub gives you a pristine upgrade for a fraction of the cost!</b></p>
<p><a href="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_455396629.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1361" src="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_455396629-300x200.jpg" alt="Bathtub refinishing Orlando Fl" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_455396629-300x200.jpg 300w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_455396629-768x512.jpg 768w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_455396629-624x416.jpg 624w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_455396629.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s nothing like soaking in a bathtub to wash away the stress of your day. But older tubs can come with a laundry list of problems that can be far from relaxing. So of course, homeowner across Orlando, Florida, and the nation all find themselves wondering from time to time &#8212; what if I upgraded my bathtub?</span></p>
<p>After a few moments online searching for the best way to upgrade your bathroom, aspiring home improvers will quickly find there’s one of two ways to give your tub a new lease on life: Replacing your bathtub with a brand new unit or refinishing it to restore it to like brand new condition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we asked the experts at BathPro (one of the most well respected companies for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bath Tub Refinishing Orlando</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> natives have trusted for over 20 years) to give us the inside scoop on the benefits and pitfalls of undertaking a tub upgrade.</span></p>
<p>One of the misconceptions people have about installing a brand new tub is the cost. They initially think that it is a fairly easy and inexpensive process. Wander the isles of your local hardware stores and you’re likely to find a new tub for around $300. Which is not too far from the cost of refinishing your old tub. But experts agree that while the price tag on a brand new tub may not be bank breaking, the hidden costs of installing it often exceed what homeowners are prepared to invest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing a new tub is far from plug and play. Homeowners must consider the many aspects of a new tub install &#8212; demolition and removal of the old tub, relocation of plumbing, carpentry work, installation of the new unit, etc. The multitude of steps can easily balloon the overall cost to over ten times the price of the new tub itself! And that’s not even inclusive of the hassle and impact to your daily life. You may have to forego access to your tub for 5+ days. So suddenly that simple straightforward process of getting a new tub becomes anything but.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why experts recommend h<a href="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_186114752.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1357" src="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_186114752-300x200.jpg" alt="Woman in refinished Bathtub" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_186114752-300x200.jpg 300w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_186114752-768x512.jpg 768w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_186114752-624x416.jpg 624w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_186114752.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>omeowners consider the process of refinishing a bathtub. It’s straightforward, easy, and effective. It starts with carefully etching and cleaning the surface of the old tub. This helps with the adhesion between the existing materials and the new materials. Once the etch is washed off the surface it is then sanded and cleaned to further help adhesion. The next step involves the application of a primer. The chemical bonding agents in the priming process is one of the most important stages of refinishing. A good quality primer is vital to the lifetime of your finish. That is why it’s important to use the best primer available to ensure longevity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the application of two topcoats to all materials being refinished is crucial. A high gloss finish is achieved that is mold and mildew resistant, easy to maintain, and easy to clean. And as a bonus &#8212; because coatings are in effect a type of paint, homeowners can choose to refinish their tubs in a variety of colors! Offering you the chance to completely redefine your bathroom experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So experts agree! Bath tub refinishing may be the best way to upgrade to your home. And if you want the help of qualified professionals, we recommend the talented experts at BathPro. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tub refinishing Orlando FL</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> folks can be proud of.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the rise of home improvement shows flooding the airwaves, homeowners across the country are feeling more emboldened to make some major upgrades to their places of dwelling. And one of the first areas to get that makeover treatment is the bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_36813235.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1352" src="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_36813235-300x201.jpg" alt="Refurbished Bathroom" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_36813235-300x201.jpg 300w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_36813235-768x514.jpg 768w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_36813235-624x417.jpg 624w, http://bathprorefinishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_36813235.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a sledgehammer to your walls and floor may make for great TV, but major redesigns can be a real nightmare for the average homeowner. Especially when it comes to cost. According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BathPro Refinishing Orlando</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a well respected home refinishing firm in the Orlando area), the average consumer may see a brand new $300 tub on sale and think it’s a bargain. But they often fail to understand the financial impact of demolition, re-attaching pipes, and the complexities of a new install. These costs could easily bloom upward of $3000 &#8212; nearly ten times the cost of the tub itself!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But luckily, gutting your bathroom completely is NOT the only way to get that makeover you’ve always dreamt of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where the process of refinishing can offer homeowners a new lease on the life of their bathtubs. We asked the experts at BathPro &#8212; the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tub refinishing company Orlando</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> natives have trusted for over 20 years &#8212; to describe the benefits of refinishing vs replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their answer boils down to the numbers. On average, the cost to refinish a bathtub from start to finish comes out to under $300. Plus the 24 hour refinishing turnaround time versus the four or five days of downtime a bathtub replacement can often require makes refinishing a very compelling alternative. </span></p>
<p>Having been in service to central Florida since 1984, BathPro describes the process of refinishing in three critical steps:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etching and Cleaning: Good refinishing work requires the etching process to help with the adhesion between the existing materials and the new materials. Once the etch is washed off the surface, it is then sanded and cleaned to further help adhesion.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primer: The chemical bonding agents in the priming process is one of the most important stages of refinishing. A good quality primer is vital to the lifetime of your finish. That is why it’s important to use the best primer available to ensure longevity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topcoat: The application of two top coats to all materials being refinished is crucial. A high gloss finish is achieved that is mold and mildew resistant, easy to maintain, and easy to clean.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>For even greater impact, homeowners often pair the refinishing process with minor cosmetic upgrades. Little changes like choosing new colors for your towels or selecting artwork that compliments a new aesthetic can go a long way toward creating a vibrant bathroom experience that feels fresh and new. Even simple upgrades to other bathroom fixtures or a new coat of paint on the walls, when combined with an expertly refinished bathtub, can completely redefine your bathroom experience.</p>
<p>The end result &#8212; the feeling of a brand new bathtub for a fraction of the cost and virtually little impact to the day to day lives of homeowners. Ultimately, the process of bathtub refinishing maintains the integrity of a home’s original design, while giving residents a chance to enjoy the feeling of a brand new bathroom without paying an arm and a leg.</p>
